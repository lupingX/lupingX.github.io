title: Algorithms-in-Python?
---

<p class="lead"> From this book, I want to practice algorithm and Python. I will record all the necessary tips about python and keep the code</p>
[Algorithm in python](https://lupingX.github.io/materials/algorithms-in-python.pdf).

>This book is very useful and I strongly recommand this to practice your code.

## Chapter one:Python Primer
>[1] bool int float tuple str are immutable which means they can't be changed at the id place.
[2] The difference of tuple and list(mutable vs immutable)
[3] Raise error=> try: except: finally: syntax
[4] How do iterator and generators(**yield**) work
this chapter is basically as a refence or handbook for me. If anything confused me, then turn back and have a look at this chapter.
