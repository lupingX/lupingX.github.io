## Chapter: Computer Network and IP address.##
><br>ip address contains network ip and host ip. The total ip address is 2^32 which means we use 32 bits to represent.
<br>network ip address is divided into five classes(A-[1-126] B-(128-191) C-(192-223) D maybe for group? and E maybe for army)  A(8|network 24|host)
B(16|nework 16|host) C(24|network 8|ip)
<br>Casting(unicast(one ip to another) Broadcast[limited-255.255.255.255] Directed BC- Network ip + 255.)

ex what is 200.1.10.100-(Class C and network ip:200.1.0.0 ) and DBA(200.1.10.255) and LBA(255.255.255.255)

Limited BA means broadcast to yourself, but DB is broadcast to another network
